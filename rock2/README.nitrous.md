# Setup

Welcome to your Rocket.Chat project on Nitrous.

## Running the development server:

In the [Nitrous IDE](https://community.nitrous.io/docs/ide-overview), enter the following commands in the terminal window:

1. `cd ~/code/Rocket.Chat`
2. `meteor --port 0.0.0.0:3000`

Now you've got a development server running and can see the output in the Nitrous terminal window. You can open up a new shell or utilize [tmux](https://community.nitrous.io/docs/tmux) to open new shells to run other commands.

## Preview the app

In the Nitrous IDE, open the "Preview" menu and click "Port 3000".
